    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Garlic bread is easy to make and is the perfect side dish for dinner.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 loaf French or Italian bread (approx. 24" long)</li>
        <li>6 Tbsp butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. In a bowl, stir together the room-temperature butter, olive oil, minced garlic, garlic powder, chopped parsley, and salt until relatively smooth (a few small lumps of butter are okay).</li>
        <li>Cut the loaf in half, into two 12" long pieces, then cut each piece open lengthwise. Lay the bread on a baking sheet cut sides facing up. Spread the garlic butter mixture evenly over the open surfaces of the bread.*</li>
        <li>Bake the bread for 10-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and crispy. Bake for less time if you prefer a softer garlic bread, and more time if you prefer a crispier garlic bread. Cut the bread into 2-inch sections and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
